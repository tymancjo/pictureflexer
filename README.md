# Pictureflexer toolbox
This tool is about to detect faces and prepare ID badge photo

usage:
put your input files into 'src' folder (the src folder need to be in the same directory where the picFlex.py main file is) and run the picFlex.py.
It might take some time to process lot of pictures!

the final ones shall land in the 'final' folder as jpg files. 

there is a bunch of libraries required, the project is prepared with the uv as a package and project managemet, but you can install the libraries yourself - all is in the pyproject.toml file.
